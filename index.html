                <p>I am Lillian Shern. There's something I did since this year's May! I've spent most of my life learning. I am currently the leader of Nightingale, an non-profit student organization currently helping the people in need, namely through preparing and handing out food as well as cleaning up the environment. It was a design thinking project initially created by Salina and Christina in 2018. I succeeded in 2019 and I have arranged those sessions with other groups and also trying to find more places for the students to help, learn more about the things we won't learn from the curriculum and also provide community service hours.</p>
                <p>Now I'm just writing on this p to see whether this would work on the about me page. Hope you can learn more about Lillian as you progressed to look at the later pages. Thank you for taking time to read this long "short descroption," I wish you a happy weekend.</p>
